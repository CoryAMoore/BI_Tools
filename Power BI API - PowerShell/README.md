# Power BI API - PowerShell
This is a sample PowerShell script showing a basic method for connecting to the Power BI REST API to collect basic inventory information about a Power BI Service environment (such as Workspaces, Datases, and Reports).  This sample also includes a very basic SSIS package to import the data into a set of Microsoft SQL Server database tables.
