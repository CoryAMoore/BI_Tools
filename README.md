# BI Tools

This repository is a collection of samples (references from my blog at jpries.com) as well as scripts, utilities, and minor tools that I've developed over time for working with the Microsoft BI Stack (SSRS, SSIS, SSAS, PowerBI, SQL)

Each subfolder within this repository represents a different sample or application, most of which will be PowerShell scripts or c# applications which are part of Visual Studio Solutions (Visual Studio 2019).  Each subfolder will contain a readme telling more about the project.

The information held within this site is intended for educational and informational purposes only.  None of this code should be used in any production environment without substantial testing and most of it is not intended to be any soft of turn-key solution that will work in other environments without customization and modification.
